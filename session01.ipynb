       "'(Brodo) To obtain good broth the meat must be put in cold water, and then allowed to boil slowly. Add to the meat some pieces of bones and \"soup greens\" as, for instance, celery, carrots and parsley. To give a brown color to the broth, some sugar, first browned at the fire, then diluted in cold water, may be added. While it is not considered that the broth has much nutritive power, it is excellent to promote the digestion. Nearly all the Italian soups are made on a basis of broth. A good recipe for substantial broth to be used for invalids is the following: Cut some beef in thin slices and place them in a large saucepan; add some salt. Pour cold water upon them, so that they are entirely covered. Cover the saucepan so that it is hermetically closed and place on the cover a receptacle containing water, which must be constantly renewed. Keep on a low fire for six hours, then on a strong fire for ten minutes. Strain the liquid in cheese cloth. The soup stock, besides being used for soups, is a necessary ingredient in hundreds of Italian dishes. SOUP OF \"CAPPELLETTI\" This Soup is called of \"=Cappelletti=\" or \"little hats\" on account of the shape of the \"=Cappelletti=\". First a thin sheet of paste is made according to the following directions: The best and most tender paste is made simply of eggs, flour and salt, water may be substituted for part of the eggs, for economy, or when a less rich paste is needed. Allow about a cup of flour to an egg. Put the flour on a bread board, make a hollow in the middle and break in the egg. Use any extra whites that are on hand. Knead it thoroughly, adding more flour if necessary, until you have a paste you can roll out. Roll it as thin as an eighth of an inch. A long rolling pin is necessary, but any stick, well scrubbed and sand papered, will serve in lieu of the long Italian rolling pin. Cut from this sheet of paste rounds measuring about three inches in diameter. In the middle of each circle place a spoonful of filling that must be made beforehand, composed of cooked meat (chicken, pork or veal) ground very fine and seasoned with grated cheese, grated lemon peel, nutmeg, allspice, salt. The ground meat is to be mixed with an equal amount of curds or cottage cheese. When the filling is placed in the circle of paste, fold the latter over and moisten the edge of the paste with the finger dipped in water to make it stay securely closed. These =cappelletti= should be cooked in chicken or beef broth until the paste is tender, and served with this broth as a soup.'"

If the pork is to be baked, choose that piece of the loin that has its ribs and that may weigh six or eight pounds. Lard it with garlic, rosemary or bay leaf and a few cloves, but moderately, and season with salt and pepper. This roast is very popular in Italy, where they call it =arista=.\n",

The leg of lamb comes very well in this way, baked in the oven.\n",

Put on the fire with some pieces of butter, two tablespoonfuls of olive oil and four or five strips of bacon or salt pork, when the whole has been browning for four or five minutes, put the pieces of hare inside the saucepan and season them with salt, pepper and spices.

Slice two carrots, cut the rib out of the leaves of 1/4 medium sized cabbage. Add the carrots, cabbage leaves, other vegetables, seasoning and butter to the soup, and let it boil slowly for 2-1/2 hours. The last 1/2 hour add one small handful of rice for each person.

      "Buongiorno! Since you’ve got potatoes, carrots, rosemary, and pork, we can prepare an enticing Italian dish just using these ingredients. Thinking about what we have at hand, two recipes come to mind that could bring the Italian countryside's flavor into your kitchen.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, we can take inspiration from the \"Loin of Pork Roasted\" recipe. You don't have a whole loin, but don't worry, any cut of pork will do. Grab your pork and cut it into small portions, about an inch thick – this will ensure the meat cooks evenly and helps to absorb more flavors. Sprinkle each piece with salt, pepper, and finely chopped rosemary. Let this marinate for a while to let the flavors settle in. While this is happening, we can prepare the potatoes and carrots into bite-sized pieces - this will be our rustic side dish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Put a drizzle of olive oil in a roasting pan and lay your pork pieces in, making sure not to crowd the pan. We want the meat to roast, not steam. Arrange your potato and carrot pieces around the pork. Drizzle everything with a bit more olive oil and sprinkle some salt, pepper, and rosemary on the vegetables. Pop this in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for about 30-45 minutes. You're looking for your pork to be beautifully browned, and your veggies tender and caramelized – that's when you know it's ready. \n",
      "\n",
      "The second suggestion is a twist on the Italian classic Minestrone alla Milanese. With the ingredients available, you can make a simplified one-pot pork roast with vegetable stew. Start by cutting your pork into bite-sized pieces and seasoning with salt, pepper, and rosemary as before. Now cut your potatoes and carrots into similar sizes. \n",
      "\n",
      "Take a thick-bottomed pot, smother some oil and heat it. Add your pork pieces and let it brown on all sides. This browning is key to get that rich, deep flavor in the stew. Once done, toss in the bulk of your rosemary, letting it infuse the oil and coat the pork. Now add your diced potatoes and carrots in the pot, stirring everything so that it's well combined. Add enough water to cover all the ingredients, lower the heat, and cover the pot. Let it simmer until the meat is tender and the flavors well integrated, normally around one hour or so. \n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, Italian cooking is all about savoring each ingredient's flavor, so don't rush the cooking process. There you go, two hearty Italian dishes that put your ingredients to good use. Buon appetito!\n"
