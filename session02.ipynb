       "'(Brodo) To obtain good broth the meat must be put in cold water, and then allowed to boil slowly. Add to the meat some pieces of bones and \"soup greens\" as, for instance, celery, carrots and parsley. To give a brown color to the broth, some sugar, first browned at the fire, then diluted in cold water, may be added. While it is not considered that the broth has much nutritive power, it is excellent to promote the digestion. Nearly all the Italian soups are made on a basis of broth. A good recipe for substantial broth to be used for invalids is the following: Cut some beef in thin slices and place them in a large saucepan; add some salt. Pour cold water upon them, so that they are entirely covered. Cover the saucepan so that it is hermetically closed and place on the cover a receptacle containing water, which must be constantly renewed. Keep on a low fire for six hours, then on a strong fire for ten minutes. Strain the liquid in cheese cloth. The soup stock, besides being used for soups, is a necessary ingredient in hundreds of Italian dishes. SOUP OF \"CAPPELLETTI\" This Soup is called of \"=Cappelletti=\" or \"little hats\" on account of the shape of the \"=Cappelletti=\". First a thin sheet of paste is made according to the following directions: The best and most tender paste is made simply of eggs, flour and salt, water may be substituted for part of the eggs, for economy, or when a less rich paste is needed. Allow about a cup of flour to an egg. Put the flour on a bread board, make a hollow in the middle and break in the egg. Use any extra whites that are on hand. Knead it thoroughly, adding more flour if necessary, until you have a paste you can roll out. Roll it as thin as an eighth of an inch. A long rolling pin is necessary, but any stick, well scrubbed and sand papered, will serve in lieu of the long Italian rolling pin. Cut from this sheet of paste rounds measuring about three inches in diameter. In the middle of each circle place a spoonful of filling that must be made beforehand, composed of cooked meat (chicken, pork or veal) ground very fine and seasoned with grated cheese, grated lemon peel, nutmeg, allspice, salt. The ground meat is to be mixed with an equal amount of curds or cottage cheese. When the filling is placed in the circle of paste, fold the latter over and moisten the edge of the paste with the finger dipped in water to make it stay securely closed. These =cappelletti= should be cooked in chicken or beef broth until the paste is tender, and served with this broth as a soup.'"

Slice two carrots, cut the rib out of the leaves of 1/4 medium sized cabbage. Add the carrots, cabbage leaves, other vegetables, seasoning and butter to the soup, and let it boil slowly for 2-1/2 hours. The last 1/2 hour add one small handful of rice for each person.

This is by far the most popular Italian dish, and it seems to have pleased the taste of all the peoples of the earth. The highly nutritive qualities of spaghetti and of cheese, their indispensable condiment, have been recognized by all diet authorities and, as for its palatableness, the lovers of spaghetti are just as enthusiastic and numerous outside of Italy as within the boundaries of that blessed country.

Put five or six anchovies into a colander and dip quickly into boiling water to loosen the skins, remove the salt, skin and bone them. Chop them and put over the fire in a saucepan with a generous quantity of oil and some pepper. Do not let them boil, but when they are hot add two tablespoons of butter and three or four tablespoons of concentrated tomato juice made by cooking down canned tomatoes and rubbing through a sieve. When this sauce is used to season spaghetti, these must be boiled in water that is only slightly salted and care must be taken not to let them become too soft.

      "Buongiorno! Your request for a hearty, traditional Italian pasta dish with a rich tomato sauce, garlic, olive oil, and a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese sounds absolutely delicious. I have a couple of classic recipes in mind that I think you'll love. They're both simple to prepare and don't require any baking, just as you requested.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, let's consider the \"Macaroni with Sauce\" (Maccheroni al sugo). This is a classic Italian dish that's both hearty and savory. Here's how you can prepare it:\n",
      "\n",
      "Start by boiling your macaroni in salted water until it's al dente. While your pasta is cooking, you can start on your tomato sauce. In a large saucepan, heat some olive oil and sauté a couple of cloves of minced garlic until it's fragrant. Then, add a can of crushed tomatoes, a pinch of salt, and some freshly ground black pepper. Let this simmer for about 15-20 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together. Once your pasta is cooked, drain it and return it to the saucepan. Mix it with your tomato sauce and a generous handful of freshly grated Parmesan cheese. If you like, you can also add a knob of butter for extra richness. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, if you're feeling a bit adventurous, you might want to try the \"Spaghetti, Macaroni etc.\" (Pasta Asciutta). This dish is similar to the first, but it offers a bit more flexibility in terms of the pasta and sauce you can use. \n",
      "\n",
      "For this dish, you can use either spaghetti or macaroni. The cooking process is the same as the first recipe, but you can add a bit of brown stock to your tomato sauce for extra depth of flavor. This is a great way to use up any leftover stock you might have. And of course, don't forget to finish your dish with a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both of these dishes are classic Italian comfort foods that are sure to satisfy your craving for something hearty and savory. They're also quite versatile, so feel free to add any other ingredients you like. For instance, you could add some sautéed mushrooms or bell peppers to your sauce, or even some spicy Italian sausage for a bit of a kick. \n",
      "\n",
      "Buon appetito! I hope you enjoy preparing and eating these delicious Italian pasta dishes.\n"

Picture perfectly cooked macaroni, caressed by a rich, savory tomato sauce, and finished off with a generous sprinkle of grated Parmesan. A true Italian classic!\n",
      "\n",
      "To start, you'll need to boil your macaroni in salted water until it's al dente - firm to the bite, but not hard. While your pasta is boiling, prepare your tomato sauce. Sauté some minced garlic in a good amount of olive oil until it's lightly golden. Then add your canned tomatoes and let it simmer until you have a rich, thick sauce. You could also add a pinch of red pepper flakes for a little heat, if you like. Once your pasta is drained, return it to the saucepan and mix it with your homemade sauce, tossing until every piece of macaroni is coated in that vibrant red goodness. Finish with a good dusting of freshly grated Parmesan and a drizzle of olive oil. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another dish you might enjoy is \"Spaghetti with Tomato Sauce\". This recipe is very similar to the Macaroni al Sugo, but uses spaghetti instead. The long, thin strands of spaghetti lend themselves well to the robust, garlicky tomato sauce, creating a beautiful balance of flavors. The steps are essentially the same as the macaroni recipe, but take care when boiling the spaghetti to ensure they stay firm and don't clump together. \n",
      "\n",
      "Both these dishes are great options for a hearty yet simple meal. Here's a little tip to enhance these recipes even further - consider using San Marzano tomatoes for your sauce. They are considered the best tomatoes in the world for sauces due to their sweet flavor and low acidity. And remember, the Parmesan is not just a garnish. It adds a wonderful, salty depth to the sauce, so don't be shy with it!\n",
      "\n",

At a low temperature (closer to 0), the model becomes very deterministic, tending to pick the highest-probability next tokens consistently. At a higher temperature (closer to 1 or above, depending on model) the probability distribution of possible next tokens is flattened, meaning tokens with lower original probabilities become more likely to be sampled. \n",

    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use **`temperature`** to **scale the randomness** of token selection (how adventurous the model is).\n",
    "* Use **`top_p`** to **limit the pool** of token candidates (how many possible next tokens the model may consider).\n",
    "* Both influence **diversity vs. determinism** of output, but they do so via different mechanisms.\n",
    "* For many use cases, adjusting **one** of them is sufficient (and simpler) rather than tweaking both simultaneously."
